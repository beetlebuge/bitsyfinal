Final project for Intro To Game Dev

I want to make a basic top-down game where you play as a **small insect, using size as a way to make unique locations.** Even a small patch of gravel would be a mountainous terrain for the bugs as an example.

I think you'll play as an ant, who is collecting grain for the ant hill, delivering it back to the queen. It's reminsicent of the first scene of the movie.

I'm pulling some ideas/theming from A Bug's Life, one of Pixar's older films, that captures size and how it relates to insects very well. for example, This scene highlights the way size plays into the environment: Look at the leaves, and the small hills, how each strand of grass is distinguishable.
