Final project for Intro To Game Dev

I want to make a basic top-down game where you play as a **small insect, using size as a way to make unique locations.** Even a small patch of gravel would be a mountainous terrain for the bugs as an example.

I think you'll play as an ant, who has lost the scent trail back to their anthill and is trying to find their way back through travelling to familiar locations, trying to pick up a trail that leads back home, and eventually uncovering something far more interesting.

I'm pulling some ideas/theming from A Bug's Life, one of Pixar's older films, that captures size and how it relates to insects very well. for example, This scene highlights the way size plays into the environment: Look at the leaves, and the small hills, how each strand of grass is distinguishable.
